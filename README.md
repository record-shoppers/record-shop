## What this about records?!
Here at the Record Shop we pride ourselves on bringing the most dope records out there straight to your ears! The team think its about time some fake people were made and given some Records.

## How you making these fake people?!
Using [FakerJS](http://marak.github.io/faker.js/) random people are getting generated every day, but only the best were invited to our Record Shop.

## What so special about your store?!
We followed the best guidelines available! Our Xd.Adobe file with the slickest UI out there, mixed with our clean code policy is to die for. The [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and Global CSS combo are everything and more.

## What do I do now?!
This is the next big craze and you need to be here. When we have the page up and running, you'll know. Till then, sit back and enjoy the code.

## Technolgies 
We use the __MERN__ stack. 
- MongoDB
- Express JS
- React
- Node JS

Sometimes we look out at the __MEAN__ stackers and think of crossing over, but __MERN__ will always be our first.

#### _Peace & Code_
